“1 + 1 = 3 (or more)” is an important design effect described by Josef Albers and [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/). It means that two elements in close proximity cause a visible interaction:

</figure>

This interaction can result in perceiving _information that is not there_. Beside having a negative because distracting and distorting impact on charts and graphics it can also, to use [Steve Krug’s](https://sensible.com/) words, cause undesirable “busyness” and “background noise” on websites.

Therefore, “1 + 1 = 3” is one of the effects you want to avoid, at least be aware of, when creating graphs and designing websites. (Of course, a designer always wants to keep information design principles in mind.) [Edward Tufte’s books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=edward+tufte&linkCode=ur2&tag=meiert-20&linkId=KSL5KZCJ42GG6GV3) are invaluable resources in this regard, and I recommend checking out the following excellent articles:

* Al Globus on [<cite>Principles of Information Display for Visualization Practitioners</cite>](https://web.archive.org/web/20070111090247/http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~rbm/cs100/notes/spreadsheets/tufte_paper.html) ([German](/de/publications/translations/uregina.ca/tufte/)), and
* Waynes Smith on [<cite>Graphics and Web Design Based on Edward Tufte’s Principles</cite>](https://web.archive.org/web/20070105162518/http://www.washington.edu/computing/training/561/zz-tufte.html) ([German](/de/publications/translations/washington.edu/tufte/)).
