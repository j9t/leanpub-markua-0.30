# Pipes Issue

| Foo | Bar |
| --- | --- |
| Column combinator (`||`) | `F || E` |
| Attribute presence and value selector | `E[foo|='en']` |
| Column combinator (`\|\|`) | `F \|\| E` |
| Attribute presence and value selector | `E[foo\|='en']` |

(The text of the column combinator row should be “Column combinator (||)”, “F || E””.)

Update: This may best be raised with GitHub—e.g., [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)?
